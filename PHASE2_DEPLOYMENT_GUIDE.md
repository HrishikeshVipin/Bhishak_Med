## 🗄️ Database Migration

When you push to GitHub and Railway auto-deploys, run this command in Railway terminal:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

Or use Railway's run command feature to execute:
```bash
npm run prisma:migrate
```

**Expected Changes**:
- Patient table: New auth fields (phoneVerified, password, accountType, etc.)
- Doctor table: New discovery fields (doctorType, isOnline, averageRating, etc.)
- New tables: PatientOtp, Appointment, MedicineReminder, MedicineAdherenceLog, Referral, ReferralIncentive

## 🧪 Testing the APIs

### 1. Test Patient Signup Flow

**Step 1: Send OTP**
```http
POST https://your-railway-backend.up.railway.app/api/patient-auth/send-otp

  "phone": "9876543210"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "OTP sent successfully to your phone"

## 🔍 Current Limitations & Notes

### Patient Registration:
- Self-registered patients have `doctorId = null` initially
- They will be linked to a doctor when they book their first consultation
- Account type: `APP_ACCOUNT` (vs. `LINK_BASED` for doctor-created patients)

### Twilio Free Tier:
- Can only send SMS to verified phone numbers
- Trial account watermark in SMS: "Sent from your Twilio trial account"
- Upgrade to paid for production use

### Doctor Types:
- Only 3 types supported: ALLOPATHY, AYURVEDA, HOMEOPATHY
- This is a business requirement from the user

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed against database":
- Database credentials changed or Railway service restarted
- Check `DATABASE_URL` in Railway environment variables

### "Failed to send OTP":
- Check Twilio credentials are correct
- Ensure `NODE_ENV=production` in Railway
- In development, OTPs are logged to console (not sent via SMS)

### "Too many OTP requests":
- Rate limit: 3 OTPs per hour per phone number
- Wait 1 hour or manually delete from `PatientOtp` table

### "Prisma Client not generated":
- Run `npx prisma generate` in Railway terminal
- Or add to `package.json` postinstall script
